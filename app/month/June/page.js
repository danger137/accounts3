Does the Corporate Transparency Act Apply to Your Business?
</p>
  </div>
</div>
<div className="mt-3" >
<p  id="res" className="h5  " style={{lineHeight:"30px",fontWeight:"300"}} >Under the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA), many businesses are subject to new reporting requirements that went into effect on January 1, 2024. That means certain companies are required to provide information related to their “beneficial owners,” that is, the individuals who ultimately own or control the company, to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). Failure to submit a beneficial ownership information (BOI) report may result in civil or criminal penalties, or both.</p>
</div>
<div className="mt-3" >
<p className="h4" style={{lineHeight:"30px",fontWeight:"400"}} >Subsequent Developments</p>
</div>
<div className="mt-3" >
<p  id="res" className="h5" style={{lineHeight:"30px",fontWeight:"300"}} >On March 1, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama ruled that the CTA is unconstitutional. Does that mean that businesses no longer need to comply? Not necessarily. The federal government filed an appeal on March 11, 2024, in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit. That same day, FinCEN announced that the law’s requirements are still in effect for those not involved in the court case.</p>
</div>
<div className="mt-3" >
<p  id="res" className="h5" style={{lineHeight:"30px",fontWeight:"300"}} >“While this litigation is ongoing, FinCEN will continue to implement the Corporate Transparency Act as required by Congress, while complying with the court’s order,” FinCEN stated. “Other than the particular individuals and entities subject to the court’s injunction … reporting companies are still required to comply with the law and file beneficial ownership reports as provided in FinCEN’s regulations.”</p>
</div>
<div className="mt-3" >
<p  id="res" className="h5" style={{lineHeight:"30px",fontWeight:"400"}} >More About the CTA</p>
</div>
<div className="mt-3" >

<p  id="res" className="h5" style={{lineHeight:"30px",fontWeight:"300"}} >The CTA is intended to curb illicit finance, including terrorist financing, money laundering and other illegal activities. But it could also open the door to the inspection of family offices, investment angels and other private individuals who may have been shielded from scrutiny in the past.</p>
</div>
<div className="mt-3" >

<p  id="res" className="h5" style={{lineHeight:"30px",fontWeight:"300"}} >The CTA’s rules generally apply to both domestic and foreign privately held reporting companies. For these purposes, a reporting company includes any corporation, limited liability company or other legal entity created through documents filed with the appropriate state authorities. A foreign entity includes any private entity formed in a foreign country that is properly registered to do business in the United States.</p>
</div>

<div className="mt-3" >

<p  id="res" className="h5" style={{lineHeight:"30px",fontWeight:"300"}} >The complete list of entities that are exempt from the reporting rules is too lengthy to include here, ranging from government units to not-for-profit organizations to insurance companies and more. Notably, an exemption was created for a “large operating company” that employs more than 20 persons on a full-time basis, has more than $5 million in gross receipts or sales (not including receipts and sales from foreign sources), and physically operates in the United States. However, many of these companies already must meet other reporting requirements providing comparable information.</p>
</div>
<div className="mt-3" >

<p  id="res" className="h5" style={{lineHeight:"30px",fontWeight:"300"}} >If an entity initially qualifies for the large operating company exemption but subsequently falls short, it must then file a BOI report. On the other hand, an entity that might not currently qualify for an exemption can update its status with FinCEN to potentially gain exemption status.</p>
</div>
<div className="mt-3" >
 
<p  id="res" className="h5" style={{lineHeight:"30px",fontWeight:"400"}} >Compliance Deadlines</p>
</div>
<div className="mt-3" >

<p  id="res" className="h5" style={{lineHeight:"30px",fontWeight:"300"}} >The deadline to comply depends on the entity’s date of formation. Reporting companies created or registered prior to January 1, 2024, have one year to comply by filing initial reports. Those created or registered on or after January 1, 2024, but before January 1, 2025, will have 90 days upon receipt of their creation or registration documents to file their initial reports. Entities created or registered on or after January 1, 2025, will have 30 days upon receipt of their creation or registration documents to file their initial reports.</p>
</div>
<div className="mt-3" >

<p  id="res" className="h5" style={{lineHeight:"30px",fontWeight:"300"}} > But stay tuned for more developments as the CTA case noted above goes through the appeals process. There could be other litigation as well, or Congress could make changes to the law.</p>

What Expenses Can't Be Written Off by Your Business?
</p>
  </div>
</div>
<div className="mt-3" >
<p  id="res" className="h5  " style={{lineHeight:"30px",fontWeight:"300"}} >If you check the Internal Revenue Code, you may be surprised to find that most business deductions aren’t specifically listed there. For example, the tax law doesn’t explicitly state that you can deduct office supplies and certain other expenses. Some expenses are detailed in the tax code, but the general rule is contained in the first sentence of Section 162, which states you can write off “all the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business.”</p>
</div>
<div className="mt-3" >
<p id="res" className="h5" style={{lineHeight:"30px",fontWeight:"400"}} >Basic Definitions</p>
</div>
<div className="mt-3" >

<p  id="res" className="h5" style={{lineHeight:"30px",fontWeight:"300"}} > In general, an expense is ordinary if it’s considered common or customary in the particular trade or business. For example, insurance premiums to protect a store would be an ordinary business expense in the retail industry.</p>
</div>
<div className="mt-3" >
<p  id="res" className="h5" style={{lineHeight:"30px",fontWeight:"300"}} > A necessary expense is one that’s helpful or appropriate. For example, a car dealership may purchase an automatic defibrillator. It may not be necessary for the business operation, but it might be helpful if an employee or customer suffers a heart attack. It’s possible for an ordinary expense to be unnecessary. But to be deductible, an expense must be ordinary and necessary.</p>
</div>
<div className="mt-3" >

<p id="res" className="h4" style={{lineHeight:"30px",fontWeight:"300"}} > A deductible amount must be reasonable in relation to the benefit expected. For example, if you’re attempting to land a $3,000 deal, a $65 lunch with the potential client should be OK with the IRS. (The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act eliminated most deductions for entertainment expenses but retained a 50% deduction for business meals.)</p>

<div className="mt-3" >

<p id="res" className="h5" style={{lineHeight:"30px",fontWeight:"400"}} > How the Courts May View Expenses</p>
</div>
<div className="mt-3" >

<p id="res" className="h5" style={{lineHeight:"30px",fontWeight:"300"}} > The deductibility of some expenses is clear, while others are more complicated. Not surprisingly, the IRS and courts don’t always agree with taxpayers about what is ordinary and necessary. To illustrate, here are three recent U.S. Tax Court cases in which specific taxpayer deductions were disallowed:</p>
</div>
<div className="mt-3" >
<ul style={{listStyleType:"none"}} >
    <li id="res" className="h5" style={{lineHeight:"30px",fontWeight:"300"}} >1. A married couple owned an engineering firm. For two tax years, they claimed depreciation of $76,264 on three vehicles, but didn’t provide required details, including each vehicle’s ownership, cost and useful life. They claimed $34,197 in mileage deductions and provided receipts and mileage logs, but the court found they didn’t show related business purposes. The court also found the mileage claimed included commuting costs, which can’t be written off. The court disallowed these deductions and assessed taxes and penalties. (TC Memo 2023-39) </li>
    <li id="res" className="h5" style={{lineHeight:"30px",fontWeight:"300"}} >2. The court ruled that a married couple wasn’t entitled to business tax deductions because the husband’s consulting company failed to show that it was engaged in a trade or business. In fact, invoices produced by the consulting company predated its incorporation. And the court ruled that even if the expenses were legitimate, they weren’t properly substantiated. (TC Memo 2023-80)</li>
    <li id="res" className="h5" style={{lineHeight:"30px",fontWeight:"300"}} >3. A physician specializing in gene therapy deducted legal expenses of $360,295 for two years on Schedule C of his joint tax returns. The court found that most of the legal fees were to defend the husband against personal conduct issues. The court denied the deduction for personal legal expenses but allowed a deduction for $13,000 for business-related legal expenses. (TC Memo 2023-42)  </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div className="mt-3" >

<p id="res" className="h5" style={{lineHeight:"30px",fontWeight:"300"}} >These cases and others should show the importance of maintaining careful, detailed records. Make sure that only business costs are claimed.</p>
</div>
<div className="mt-3" >

<p id="res" className="h5" style={{lineHeight:"30px",fontWeight:"400"}} >Proceed with Caution!</p>
</div>
<div className="mt-3" >

<p id="res" className="h5" style={{lineHeight:"30px",fontWeight:"300"}} >If an expense seems like it’s not normal in your industry or could be considered personal or extravagant, proceed with caution. Contact the office with questions about deductibility and proper documentation.</p>

     Sending the Kids to Day Camp May Bring a Tax Break

<div className="mt-3" >
<p id="res" className="h5  " style={{lineHeight:"30px",fontWeight:"300"}}> Among the many challenges of parenthood is childcare for kids when school lets out. Babysitters are one option, or you might consider sending them to a day camp. There’s no one-size-fits-all answer, but if you do choose a day camp, you could be eligible for a tax break.

<div className="mt-3" >
<p  id="res" className="h5" style={{lineHeight:"30px",fontWeight:"300"}}> For those qualifying for the 35% rate with maximum expenses of $3,000, the credit equals $1,050, or $2,100 for two children with expenses of at least $6,000. The applicable credit percentage drops as adjusted gross income (AGI) rises. When AGI exceeds $43,000, the percentage is 20% of qualified expenses, subject to the $3,000 or $6,000 limit.</p>

  Help Prevent Financial Scams Aimed at Older People

</div>
<div className="mt-3" >
<ul style={{listStyleType:"none"}} >
    <li id="res" className="h5  " style={{lineHeight:"30px",fontWeight:"300"}} >1. Exercise caution when making financial decisions. If someone exerts pressure or promises unreasonably high or guaranteed returns, walk away. </li>

Another scam involves someone pretending to be a grandchild who’s in trouble and needs money. Don’t provide confidential information or send money until you can verify the caller’s identity. </li>
    <li id="res" className="h5  " style={{lineHeight:"30px",fontWeight:"300"}} >3. Beware of emails requesting personal data, even if they appear to be from a real financial institution. Remember, your banker or financial professional already has your personal information. Ignore contact information provided in emails.

 Why You Should Be Using the Bill Pay Tools in QuickBooks Desktop

</div>
<div className="mt-3" >
<p id="res" className="h5  " style={{lineHeight:"30px",fontWeight:"300"}} >Thirty years ago, we didn’t have a choice: We either mailed off checks immediately or put the paper bills in a folder or on a stack. Maybe we marked their due dates on a calendar or clipped them to calendar pages a few days before the due date so we wouldn’t forget.</p>
</div>
<div className="mt-3" >
<p  id="res" className="h5" style={{lineHeight:"30px",fontWeight:"300"}} >But we sometimes forgot anyway, especially if we didn’t have a system for organizing our accounts payable.

<div className="mt-3" >
<p  id="res" className="h5" style={{lineHeight:"30px",fontWeight:"300"}} >These days, of course, you may pay your bills directly on the website of your biller or your bank. You still need to keep track of when they’re due (for example, by making a notation in Google Calendar or Outlook) and you must remember that you paid them.</p>
